# Day 1 of MLOps
Past 5 months or so, I have been continuosly building model and training them to get accuracies. But along the way, I am came to know about Deployment and maintenance of the system while in real life scenario unlike training in Juypter Notebook. Building the model is a just a tiny piece of work in ML project Lifecycle. This is where MLOps(Machine Learning Operations) comes in place. There are steps in ML project lifecycle which includes:

- **Scoping:**
Here we define the project like on what tech we gonna work, problem statement development and analysis, team management plus resources management. Secondly, We care various metrics such as accuracy, latency, etc.

- **Data:**
It includes Data extraction, warehousing, labelling and preprocessing.

- **Model Building:**
Selecting suitable model and training it. After that validating with test dataset and obtaining the accuracies. The most important part of Model building is hyper-parameter tuning. 

- **Deployment:**
It includes Deployment of the trained model in server for real use case. Similarly, Maintenance come under way which is the longest and the most important part in MLOps. When The model is deployed, we need to constantly monitor the system. 

Now, with times, data tends to change/evolve, so we may need to update and re-evalute our data and most like to re-train our model again. This is the crucial part of MLOps.
